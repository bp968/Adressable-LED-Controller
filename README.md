# Adressable-LED-Controller
Adressable led controller for ws2812 LEDs. Which are used in various computer components. Riing Plus fans, thermaltake case leds... 
This just started when a guy on reddit asked to help and things happened now, we are here. For now no images or other stuff added,
I will ask some photos from him and will made a detailed how to.

I could only verify Riing plus fans for now but I'm pretty sure i can make it competible with most ather addressable LEDs.
Also pretty sure all thermaltake adressable stuff can be controlled with this software.

If you have any RGB component with addressable LEDs contact me, please. I want to verify as much hardware as possible.
